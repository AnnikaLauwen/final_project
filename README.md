Final Project Group MMA

## Goal of the project
The goal of the current project is to explore the relation between explicit songs and female and male artists. For this, we used datasets containing statistics from Spotify
from 1999-2020. 
More specifically, we are investigating whether male or female artists have a higher ratio explicit songs, how the use of explicit songs has changed over the years for these
artists, what the effect of explicit songs has on popularity
